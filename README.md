# Hashcat Password Cracking Guide

This guide provides step-by-step instructions on how to use Hashcat, a popular password cracking tool, to crack passwords. By following these instructions, you can assess the strength of your organization's password security and identify potential vulnerabilities.

## Prerequisites

Before getting started, ensure you have the following:

- **Hashcat**: Download and install Hashcat on your system. You can find installation instructions for various operating systems on the [Hashcat website](https://hashcat.net/hashcat/).

- **Hashed Passwords**: Obtain the hashed passwords that you want to crack. These hashes can be obtained from password dumps or security assessments. You can use the [newhash.hash](newhash.hash) file for example or you can obtain any hash files form different resources.

- **Wordlist (Optional)**: Optionally, you can create or obtain a wordlist containing potential passwords. Hashcat uses wordlists for dictionary attacks.You can use the [example.dict](example.dict) file or create your own or obtain one from different available resources.

## Usage

Follow these steps to use Hashcat to crack passwords:

1. **Prepare Hashes**: Obtain the hashed passwords that you want to crack. Store them in a file, one hash per line.

2. **Create Wordlist (Optional)**: Optionally, create a wordlist containing potential passwords. You can use pre-existing wordlists or create your own based on common passwords, phrases, or patterns.

3. **Choose Attack Mode**: Decide on the attack mode to use with Hashcat. Common modes include dictionary attacks, brute-force attacks, and rule-based attacks.

4. **Run Hashcat**: Open a terminal or command prompt and run Hashcat with the appropriate command-line options. Replace `<hash-mode>`, `<hash-file>`, and `<wordlist-file>` with your specific values. Here's an example command:

   ```
   hashcat -m <hash-mode> <hash-file> <wordlist-file>
   ```

5. **Monitor Progress**: Hashcat will start running and attempt to crack the passwords using the specified wordlist or attack mode. Monitor its progress in the terminal or command prompt.

6. **View Results**: Once Hashcat finishes running, view the results to see which passwords were successfully cracked. Hashcat will display the cracked passwords along with their corresponding hashes.

7. **Analyze and Act**: Analyze the results to identify weak passwords and potential security risks. Take appropriate action, such as notifying users to change their passwords or implementing stronger password policies.

## Ethics and Legal Considerations

- **Obtain Permission**: Only crack passwords for which you have explicit permission or authorization. Unauthorized password cracking is illegal and unethical.

- **Use Responsibly**: Use Hashcat responsibly and ethically. Respect privacy and confidentiality at all times.
